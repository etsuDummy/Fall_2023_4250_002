Implementation Day Exercise

Requirements:

Mandatory

-Be recursive.
-Two Pointers or array approach
-Digit must be int (no floats)
-Take in as string; convert to int later for computations
-Limit to 5 digits for each number input by human
-Ask for the first number, followed by the second.
-Ensure that input is a valid string full of ints. (No char)

Optional

-Can guess their end result
-Exit the program when the result reaches a single digit.
-Exit the program after 3 incorrect entries (sarcastic error message)

Requirement         Code            Test Elements
Be recursive        Recursion()     Check math
                                    Check loops
                                    
User input          Scanner Object  Only int input works
                                    5 digit limit
                                    2 inputs collected
                                    
Exit the Program    N/A             End when number found
                                    End when incorrect input 3 times
